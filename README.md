# Chrome Extension

This chrome extension uses Chrome's Extension API and Youtube's Data API to detect YouTube urls and to block YouTube videos not in the Education or Science & Technology categories. The extension runs on a timer you specify from 30 minutes to 3 hours to block videos. 
The use of this extension is to help people break their bad YouTube binging habits, including mine, so that they can focus on educational YouTube videos instead of random ones.
