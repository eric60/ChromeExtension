# Chrome Extension

###Application Purpose
This Chrome extension helps people break their bad YouTube binging habits(including mine!), so that they can focus on educational YouTube videos instead of random ones. 

###Overview
The application uses Chrome's Extension API and Youtube's Data API to detect YouTube urls and to block YouTube videos not in the Education or Science & Technology categories. The extension runs on a timer you specify from 30 minutes to 3 hours to block videos.
