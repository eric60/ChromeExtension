# Chrome Extension - YouTube Scholar

### Application Purpose
This Chrome extension helps people break their bad YouTube binging habits(including mine!), so that they can focus on educational YouTube videos and become a YouTube Scholar.

### Overview
The application uses Chrome's Extension API and Youtube's Data API to detect YouTube urls with regex, and blocks YouTube videos not in the Education or Science & Technology categories. The extension blocks videos on a user defined timer from 30 minutes up to 3 hours.
